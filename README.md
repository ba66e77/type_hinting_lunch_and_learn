Type Hinting Lunch and Learn
============================

The `type_hinting.ipynb` file here is intended to be used as the demonstration file for an "lunch and learn" session on type hinting in Python. It's expected to cover the basics of type hinting in a 30-minute session, including questions, for an audience familiar with Python programming and with a passing knowledge of object oriented programming

The content is written to work in Python 3.11 and empahasizes use of the VSCode IDE.

See the included LICENSE.txt for licensing details but, tl;dr, content is available for any use and provided without warranty or expectation of maintenance.

YMMV. IANAL. Godspeed and goodluck.
